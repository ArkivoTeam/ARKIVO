# Arkivo
Arkivo ontology is designed to accomodate archival description, including collection hierarchy 
(for archives typically as Fonds, Series, Files, Items etc.) as well as metadata of the 
digitized and born-digital items. It includes historical events, people, places, organizations and other entities in archival items, 
as well as relationships between them.
