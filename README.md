**arkivo** ontology is designed to accomodate archival description, including collection hierarchy (for archives typically as Fonds, Series, Files, Items etc.) as well as metadata of the digitized and born-digital items. It includes historical events, people, places, organizations and other entities in archival items, as well as relationships between them. ARKIVO ontology is intended for presentation of archival objects and relationships in Linked Open Data environment. Regarding underlying technology, ARKIVO ontology uses W3C's [OWL 2](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/) language.
